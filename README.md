## Installation

Download the latest binary for your platform from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/stigoleg/keep-alive/releases/latest).

### macOS and Linux

1. Download the archive for your platform:
```bash
# For macOS:
curl -LO https://github.com/stigoleg/keep-alive/releases/latest/download/keep-alive_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz

# For Linux:
curl -LO https://github.com/stigoleg/keep-alive/releases/latest/download/keep-alive_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

2. Extract the archive:
```bash
tar xzf keep-alive_*_x86_64.tar.gz
```

3. Move the binary to a location in your PATH:
```bash
sudo mv keepalive /usr/local/bin/
```

### Windows

1. Download the Windows archive from the [releases page](https://github.com/stigoleg/keep-alive/releases/latest)
2. Extract the archive
3. Move `keepalive.exe` to your desired location
4. (Optional) Add the location to your PATH environment variable

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
keepalive
```

2. Use arrow keys (â†‘/â†“) or j/k to navigate the menu
3. Press Enter to select an option
4. When entering minutes, use numbers only (e.g., "150" for 2.5 hours)
5. Press q or Esc to quit

## How It Works

Keep-Alive uses platform-specific APIs to prevent your system from entering sleep mode:

- **macOS**: Uses the `caffeinate` command to prevent system and display sleep
- **Windows**: Uses SetThreadExecutionState to prevent system sleep
- **Linux**: Uses systemd-inhibit to prevent the system from going idle/sleep

The application provides three main options:
1. Keep system awake indefinitely
2. Keep system awake for X minutes (enter the number of minutes)
3. Quit the application

When running with a timer, the application shows a countdown of the remaining time. You can stop the keep-alive at any time by pressing Enter to return to the menu or q/Esc to quit the application.
